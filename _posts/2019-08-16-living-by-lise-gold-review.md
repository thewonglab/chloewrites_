Behold, a new book by Lise Gold. Probably one of the more prolific lesfic writers out there. This one is another solid offering, a standalone outside of her recent *Compass* series.

*Living* follows Ella, a Hollywood star struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide after the death of her twin sister two years prior to the start of the novel, and Cam, a yoga teacher who rescues Ella from herself on the beach one day. Six months later, the two are reunited and embark on a friendship which grows into mutual attraction and — dare I say it — love.

Lise Gold doesn’t shy away from writing about darker themes — first with alcoholism in *Fireflies*, and now mental health in *Living*. There is a content warning for attempted suicide so readers should be aware of that before diving in (pun not intended). 

There is a good interview on Gold’s writing process that my friend linked me to, which touches on how she approaches the locations in her books. As usual, in *Living* there’s a lot of exploration and connection to space and location. In this case, the focus is on Hollywood and the wider California area, of the beach where Cam’s home is, and Palm Springs where Ella grew up and has a home. I appreciated the time spent with the characters exploring and revisiting those places, which are familiar to them separately in different ways, and over the course of the story they open themselves up to each other and thus experience their respective homes with new eyes. 

It’s one of the best parts of the book and wends well into the theme. Life is best lived with good company, with open arms, and both Cam and Ella are given a new lease on their previously ordinary (to them) life.

The characters’ chemistry is pretty electric. The love scenes are hot, their attraction is palpable, and their ease around one another as they grow into their relationship is a strength of the book. Ella’s character arc is also a highlight and a subplot touches on her relationship with her mother, and how she navigates that particular connection over the story.

A few things drew me out of the reading experience: at times, the dialogue occasionally bordered on expository and I always find it hard to get into the trope of celebrity-falls-for-regular-person. That’s on me and the nature of my working life, so anyone who digs that dynamic will like this book. I also would’ve liked more exploration into any internal conflict from Cam’s perspective over the papparazzi and dating someone very famous as such a down-to-earth character. She just seemed so chill and perhaps I need to do some yoga to attain that level of supportive zen master. So again, that’s on me as the reader. 

Despite all that, the themes that are covered in *Living* — healing, confronting mental health issues, coming back to life and trusting others around you and, indeed, *living* — are well paced, well written, and very touching.

As it always is after I finish a Lise Gold book, I wait impatiently for the next, which I hope is the fourth installment of the *Compass* series. 

Solid 3.5/5 stars
