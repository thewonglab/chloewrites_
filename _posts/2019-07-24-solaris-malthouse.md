title: SOLARIS @ Malthouse Theatre, 21 July 2019
---

*Dir: Matthew Lutton*

I went to see *Solaris* last Sunday. This is just a casual note as I was really looking forward to seeing it. It was good, with excellent stage design. I think that's the one thing that Melbourne theatre always shines at. But it was only good. With a cast of Leeanna Walsman and Hugo Weaving, and supported by other excellent actors, I expected something a little more elevated, especially with the source material we’re talking about. It’s based on the novel rather than the two films that were adapted from it; and the writer also gender-swapped the main character from a man to a woman. Pretty neat idea, one that we don’t see often enough, especially when the themes the work contains transcend gender.

I wanted to love it but I didn’t. It didn’t go on for long enough — it went for 100 minutes when it could easily have taken another 20 to 30 minutes of my time, to go truly deep into how the characters are affected by the visitors. They felt like archetypes, mere foils for the protagonist, and skimmed over what could've been a deep study into the philosophy and ethics of exploration, making contact with *other* life. The cast were incredible and the actors more than capable; Leeanna especially can carry a stage show for sure, as we saw in *Melancholia* last year. 

A part of me wonders if the actors were directed adequately, if the script held the source material at arm's length. Maybe they thought an audience wouldn't last two hours with it. (I've sat through a bunch of looooooooong plays from MTC so I daresay I might've survived.) Overall, a lot of the play felt like exposition and I left just feeling like it was a bit of a wasted opportunity. So many things great, so many things fell short.

It was just... fine. And I'm kinda cut up about that. 

Ah well. Is this not the nature of art?
