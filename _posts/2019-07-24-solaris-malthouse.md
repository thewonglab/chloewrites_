title: SOLARIS @ Malthouse Theatre, 21 July 2019
---

*Dir: Matthew Lutton*

I went to see *Solaris* last Sunday. This is just a casual note as I was really looking forward to seeing it. It was good, with excellent stage design. I think that's the one thing that Melbourne theatre always shines at. But it was only good. I thought I didn't expect anything, but maybe I thought it'd be something a little more elevated, especially with the source material. It’s based on the novel rather than the two films that were adapted from it; the writer also gender-swapped the main character from a man to a woman. Pretty neat idea, especially when the themes transcend gender.

I wanted to love it but I didn’t. It didn’t go on for long enough — it went for 100 minutes when it could easily have taken another 20 to 30 minutes of my time. The supporting characters felt like archetypes, mere foils for the protagonist, and skimmed over what could've been a deep study into the philosophy and ethics of exploration, making contact with *other* life. The cast were incredible and the actors more than capable; Leeanna especially can carry a stage show for sure, as we saw in *Melancholia* last year. 

A part of me wonders if the actors were directed adequately, if the script held the source material at arm's length. Maybe they thought an audience wouldn't last two hours with deep and meaningful content. (I've sat through a bunch of loooooong plays from MTC so I daresay I might've survived...) Overall, a lot of the play felt like exposition and I left just feeling like it was a bit of a wasted opportunity. So many things great, so many things fell short.

It was just... fine. And I'm kinda cut up about that. 

Ah well. Is this not the nature of art?
