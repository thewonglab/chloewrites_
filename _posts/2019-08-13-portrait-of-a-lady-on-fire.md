title: Portrait of a Lady on Fire @ MIFF 
---

So I went and saw the aforementioned at MIFF on Saturday night. It's the only film I managed to get tickets for as I'd forgotten the festival was even on until a friend tweeted about it. Quickly asked for a recommendation and was told about *Portrait*, booked tickets, and then saw various tweets popping up about it. Still didn't know what it was about. I'm the type of person who goes in blind and trusts in word-of-mouth, repetitious marketing, or actors I like.

Can I just say. *Portrait* paid off. *Portrait* saw *Call Me by Your Name* and took that damn pretentious wanky Italian-sun drenched navel gaze of a movie to school. R asked me what it was about on the way to the cinema and I only knew enough to tell her "Something gay, and also it's a period drama," which looking back now is pretty much the perfect pitch for any kind of movie I'd pay to see. Between this and *Gentleman Jack* I feel really well looked after in the lesbian romance department this quarter!

In all seriousness, as I pitched it in the lunchroom for an interested exec, it's about a painter who is commissioned in 1760 to paint a wedding portrait for this other lady, but ends up falling in love with her.

Why can't I pitch my own work this succinctly?

I also mentioned that the premise probably wouldn't fly outside of the period genre as you'd just take a photograph and be done with it these days.

**What did I love about it** (besides everything): <br>
- The pacing. Céline Sciamma nailed the script, the pacing, the lush, longing cinematography.
- The dialogue. So sparse, so lean, and every single line was gold.
- The acting. So good! It's mostly a two-hander and Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel were top class. A pairing that rivaled the two Rachels in *Disobedience*, to make a glib comparison. I looked it up after and turns out Haenel used to be in a relationship with Sciamma. Ah, queer romance. So incestuous.
- The tropes! Let me count the ways... but the main one is the painter furtively stealing glances to commit her subject's visage to memory, under the guise of being a lady companion for walks - help!

Of course, being a French film, there was some weird/odd/creepy stuff happening. Nothing as weird as the creepy stalker text plotline in *Personal Shopper* where, maybe I was missing something, but anyway. The weird stuff all fit in with the Orpheus/Eurydice mythology that was weaved into the film as well, and actually serves as the thematic foundation of the entire movie.

The more I think on it, the more layers emerge from the film and I'm just amazed at how much was packed into the two hours, with such a tight script, such incredibly lean dialogue and pacing... I can't get over it.

(Speaking of *Personal Shopper*, perhaps the previous best two-hander cast in French cinema was Kristen Stewart + iPhone?)

But I digress. *Portrait of a Lady on Fire* is a masterclass in desire. And truly refreshing that it's a woman, a queer woman, who made this film. I can only point to the shower scene in *Blue is the Warmest Colour* for an example of an extremely discomfiting male gaze in French lesbian cinema. In *Portrait*, there was only a very strange armpit scene that can compare, but I get it — we all need a scene similar to the one in *Disobedience* where they spat in each other's mouths before we can really say: yes, that is how lesbians have sex.

4.5/5 stars
