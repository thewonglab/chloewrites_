title: The Women in Line of Duty
---

<!--Line of Duty is one of my favourite shows. Having grown up on a series of cop procedurals like *SVU*, *Law & Order*, and *JAG*, as I grew older this interest carried over into another concept that holds my interest greatly: science fiction and mystery. My favourite shows became *Battlestar Galactica*, *Fringe*, and *Person of Interest*. The latter two shows and, to an extent, *BSG* as well, melded the cop procedural with philosophy and government conspiracy. --> 

<!--Of all these, *Person of Interest* (PoI) might hold the closest comparison to BBC's *Line of Duty* (LoD). Both shows hold an element of noir for each protagonist â€” Team Machine for PoI, and AC-12 for LoD - and both tackle a dramatic question of "Do the good guys win over the evil and insiduous root of corruption?" Thematically, PoI and LoD address the ideas of loyalty, family, and duty. Crucially, both shows eventually thrust strong female characters into the main action: Root and Shaw in PoI; Kate in LoD alongside series 2-4 antagonists DI Lindsay Denton and DCI Roz Huntley. -->
