title: It's Me Again
---

Here I am procrastinating on my latest deadline. I’ve been thinking and talking about writing and blogging since the beginning of the year and I think I’ve formed a good way to approach it. I took a break from my previous iteration as I felt the angle was one that I’ve grown out of now — and, in fact, the angle I took with that blog seems like a symptom of a lot of the way I’ve lived my life so far: as a series of “shoulds” rather than “wants”. To wit, I thought my blog should be about something (I don’t know what) and carved out a sort of “something” accordingly. But after a bit of soul searching, I realised I’m literally writing s** into a void which people may or may not read, so who gives? Do whatever you want and if it works for you, great; if not, the stakes are so low that really… who gives.

So right now, this is making me happy and contributing to my overall level of contentment with my life, especially on a day off which is meant to be for work but instead I am procrastinating and starting this new project (this blog). It’s amazing what you have time for when you’re not punching in and out of work between 8-6pm five days a week. Who would’ve thought.

Speaking to that, not long back I took two weeks off from work and in the aftermath I actually feel... good? Definitely fine, and at least okay. I don’t think I was in a great space *during* the two weeks off (relatively speaking) and for a moment I was concerned that the feeling wouldn’t end. But I’ve come out the other side with a better — not grasp, not understanding, but maybe a better hold on boundaries so I’ll take it. Kind of reminds me of Marta’s call to arms after Brazil was eliminated from the Women’s World Cup:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brazilian soccer player Marta gave a powerful speech for young girls after Brazil&#39;s World Cup elimination: &quot;The women&#39;s game depends on you to survive&quot; <a href="https://t.co/D8YPPeeNY6">pic.twitter.com/D8YPPeeNY6</a></p>&mdash; BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/1143898541892481024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2019</a></blockquote>

The most surprising part about my time off was where I read a book! I finished an actual, physical book. I count them differently to e-books due to the physical 3D nature of a printed book — it might be something to do with being able to see your progress with pages, rather than a percentage at the corner of a screen. But I wrote down all the books I’ve read over the last 4 months and I’ve actually finished a fair few. The book I read was *Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive* by Charles Duhigg. 

I read it surprisingly quickly, over a couple of days. It’s a really easy and accessible read. I don't know if productivity is really a "secret" over, say, having resources to delegate other things combined with motivation and determination, but Duhigg uses anecdotes to exemplify the eight principles he proposes implementing to work, think, and live Smarter Faster and Better. I don’t know that I’m any more productive for having read it (my due document is definitely not getting the benefit, but this blog is, so how do I measure?) but I did take at least one thing away. The stickiest concept from the book is the **SMART** way of planning goals and organising for success in achieving them.

1. Being **Specific** in your goal 
2. Making that goal **Measurable**,
3. **Achievable**
4. and **Realistic**
5. Come up with a **Timeline** for completion
 
I’ve started putting my web development studies into that framework with the aim to complete two hours of video (stretch goal: three hours) and finish the entire 47 hours by November. Seems doable. I gave myself a lot of leeway around working, other writing projects, going away in October, and accounted for my general levels of motivation and discipline during the work-week. So we’ll see how we go there.

With that, I probably should apply the SMART goals to my document due on Monday… see you all next time!
