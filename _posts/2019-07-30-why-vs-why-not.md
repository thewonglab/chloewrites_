A while back at work I came across a combination of medications that didn’t make sense to me. It wasn’t *wrong*, per se; it just didn’t make sense for the way the medications were meant to work. It wasn’t correct, but it wasn’t wrong. It was a “why not?” combination — but I couldn’t think of a reason for the converse: *why*? 

Well, that’s not necessarily true… I can think of a reason why the doctor would do that. Whether or not it’s truly logical is another matter. But with that scenario I realised that the why/why not dynamic is one that I don’t think I consider often enough. 

It’s easy enough to look at a reason to do something and go, “Oh well, why not?” and if it doesn’t work out, at least you gave it a go. But I think now that I’m getting older I’m more cognisant of the fact that I don’t have all of my prime years to keep “giving it a go.” Especially with my writing and my career, my priorities are changing and I do want to settle down, keep growing roots and stop having to adjust my rudder all the damn time. And when I really think about it, most of the time the lackadaisical attitude offered by “why not?” is not equally matched by the laser-sharp motivation of “why?” One is a directionless sail, swept any which way by the wind, while the other is a disciplined, razor-edge challenge for reason. 

**Why** do you want this job? <br>
**Why** do you want to be with this person? <br>
**Why** do you want to catch up with this friend?<br>
**Why** do you want to write this book? <br>
**Why** do you want this apartment? (in terms of, vs. a house or some other apartment elsewhere)

I think I feel a sense of whimsy and, consequently, a lack of determination and arbitrariness (it’s a word now) when using “why not?” when really, I know what I want even if I may not have the means to articulate those wants. And I think ever since people have started commenting upon or asking why I want to write (or maybe it’s even something else that I’m not conscious of), I’ve used “why not?” as a deflection from my innermost deepest reasons which other people should not be privy to off a merely curious wanting to know. And over time I’ve started to believe that “why not?” is a legitimate reason to do certain things. 

IT IS NOT!!!!!

“Why not” is in no way, shape, or form, EVER, an adequate reason to do anything, at any time, any where. “Why not” is not a reason, it is a cop-out. It is a placeholder in lieu of true conviction.

And not even that — we shouldn’t just be asking “why?” We should be asking, “Why should I?” 

**Why should I** take this job?<br>
**Why should I** stay with with this person?<br>
**Why should I** spend this time to catch up with this friend?<br>
**Why should I** write this book? (I think this is a pertinent question for many writers out there who definitely use “why not” instead of “why” and never properly interrogate their motivation for a piece of creative work!!)<br>
**Why should I** buy this apartment?

I think it poses a deeper challenge, only subtly, but the difference is there. And maybe it isn’t relevant for all things — such as the last question, for example, or maybe there is a relevance that I’m not privy to yet.

I think for me, it’s not so much that I should stop giving things a go. I should keep challenging myself, and keep searching out different things, different ways, different experiences. The key difference between “why” and “why not” is that WHY makes sure that I’m giving the right things a go, for the right motivation. It interrogates for meaning. I just feel that “why not” is such a Katy Perry thing: a plastic bag drifting in the wind, wanting to start again at the next “why not”. Does anything good come out of a deliberate “why not?” And on the other hand, doesn’t a “why” yield more results, at a much more consistent rate?

Some things to think on. 

_In other news:_<br>
* Finally splurged and went all out on a subscription to the Economist. Have been lukewarm about it because of the cost and tried the print sub for a few weeks. I liked the articles but I’m so digital these days it was hard to break out of the habit. The upside to the digital sub is having access to an audio version of most articles - it’s like listening to the BBC or some AM frequency news channel.

* I went to see the play *Solaris* at Malthouse Theatre last Sunday. It was good, with excellent stage design. But only good. With a cast of Leeanna Walsman and Hugo Weaving, and supported by other excellent actors, I expected something a little more elevated, especially with the source material we’re talking about. It’s based on the novel rather than the two films that were adapted from it; and the writing team also gender-swapped the main character from a man to a woman. Pretty neat idea, one that we don’t see often enough, especially when the themes the work contains transcend gender. I wanted to love it but I didn’t. It didn’t go on for long enough — it went for 100 minutes when it could easily have taken another 20 to 30 minutes of my time, to go truly deep into how the characters are affected by the visitors. I felt it didn’t go deep enough into the themes, and the motivations for the characters. The cast are incredible; Leeanna especially can carry a stage show for sure, as we saw in *Melancholia* last year. Were they directed adequately? A lot of the play felt like exposition, and I left just feeling like it was a bit of a wasted opportunity. So many things great, so many things fell short. Ah well. Is this not the nature of art?
